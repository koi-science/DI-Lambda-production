Use Insert.dxf to cut the outlines. Note that the file also contains the fold lines. Either remove
them before cutting, or cut them with minimial power to only mark the lines.

Use a ruler and a flat screwdriver to indent the fold lines, then fold the insert in accordance with the
drawing. Practive makes perfect.
